Udemy Courses Subscribers Prediction

This project analyzes Udemy courses and predicts the number of subscribers based on features such as price, duration, level, and subject.

ðŸ”¹ Objective

Build a regression model to understand what factors influence course popularity and help creators optimize their strategies.

ðŸ”¹ Approach

Data cleaning & preprocessing (handling categories, timestamps, outliers)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations

Model building: Linear Regression & Polynomial Regression

Evaluation with MAE, RMSE, and RÂ²

ðŸ”¹ Results

Polynomial Regression performed better than Linear Regression

RÂ² â‰ˆ 0.57, explaining ~57% of variance in subscriber counts

ðŸ”¹ Future Work

Try advanced models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting)

Feature scaling & engineering

Text analysis of course titles/descriptions

ðŸ”¹ Tech Stack

Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Dataset: Udemy Online Education Courses - Kaggle
